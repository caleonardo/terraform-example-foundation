# 1-org

The purpose of this step is to setup top level shared folders, monitoring & networking projects, org level logging and set baseline security settings through organizational policy.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
2. Cloud Identity / Gsuite group for security admins
3. Membership in the security admins group for user running terraform

## Usage

**Disclaimer:** This step enables [Data Access logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#data-access) for all services in your organization.
Enabling Data Access logs might result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage.
For details on costs you might incur, go to [Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing).
You can choose not to enable the Data Access logs by setting variable `data_access_logs_enabled` to false.

### Setup to run via Cloud Build
1. Clone repo `gcloud source repos clone gcp-org --project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID` (this is from terraform output from the previous section, 0-bootstrap).
1. Navigate into the repo `cd gcp-org` and change to a non prod branch `git checkout -b plan`
1. Copy contents of foundation to new repo `cp -R ../terraform-example-foundation/1-org/* .` (modify accordingly based on your current directory).
1. Copy cloud build configuration files for terraform `cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* . ` (modify accordingly based on your current directory).
1. Copy terraform wrapper script `cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh . ` (modify accordingly based on your current directory).
1. Ensure wrapper script can be executed `chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh`.
1. Rename terraform.example.tfvars to terraform.tfvars and update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap (you can re-run `terraform output` in the 0-bootstrap directory to find these values). Make sure that `default_region` is set to a valid [BigQuery dataset region](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations).
1. Commit changes with `git add .` and `git commit -m 'Your message'`
1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan `git push --set-upstream origin plan` (the branch `plan` is not a special one. Any branch which name is different from `dev`, `nonprod` or `prod` will trigger a terraform plan).
    1. Review the plan output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to prod branch with `git checkout -b prod` and `git push origin prod`
    1. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

### Run terraform locally
1. Change into 1-org/envs/shared/ folder.
1. Rename terraform.example.tfvars to terraform.tfvars and update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap.
1. Update backend.tf with your bucket from bootstrap.
1. Run `terraform init`
1. Run `terraform plan` and review output.
1. Run `terraform apply`
